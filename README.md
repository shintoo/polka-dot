#polka-dot
A simple dotfile and configuration manager.

##Installation
Run `sh compile`, then move the resulting executable to your PATH.

##Usage
polka-dot comes with four commands:
- `save`  
- `apply`  
- `rm`  
- `list`  
- `show`  
  
polka-dot works with a config file that must be written, containing a path to the file to be packaged.  

Example config file:
```
~/.vimrc
~/.Xdefaults
~/.gtkrc-2.0
~/.i3/config
```

###save
`polka-dot save package-name`  
`save` will package the files listed in the config file into a polka-dot *package*.

###apply
`polka-dot apply package-name`  
`apply` will apply the polka-dot package to the files listed in the config file.

###rm
`polka-dot rm package-name`  
`rm` will remove the polka-dot package from polka-dot.

###list
`polka-dot list`  
`list` will list all of the currently saved packages.
  
###show
`polka-dot show`
`show` will list all of the files currently queued for packaging.  

##Notes  
- polka-dot will not save your current configuration when `apply` is used, so make sure to `save` before you `apply` if you wish to save your current configuration before changing!  
- Many programs require some sort of reload or restart to apply their config. To see the effects of `apply`, make sure to do any required refreshes.
